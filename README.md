### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I'm working on a MERN todo-list app to develop familiarity with MongoDB and Express as well as strengthen my React and Node skills. In addition, over the coming months, I plan to continue on with the London-Mock-Exchange project to build features such as a leaderboard, allowing live trading, and to continue building on my knowledge of Django and React.

Please feel free to have a look through my repositories, they showcase the skills I've learned over the past 3 months. I'd also happily take any feedback on any of the projects I have created, as I am continuously looking for ways to become a better and stronger developer.
